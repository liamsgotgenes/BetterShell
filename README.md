# BetterShell

A light-weight shell written in C. I made this to drastically improve upon the [shell](https://github.com/liamsgotgenes/TinyShell) I created for my Operating Systems course by adding features such as tab completion, process control and terminal modes.
I plan to continue develop this and add more features when I find the time.

## Future Features/Improvements
- Improve tab completion
- Improve foreground/background process to allow moving any background process to the foreground, not just the most recent one
- Add command history
- Session variables
- Alias declarations
